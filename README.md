You are welcome to fork this repository but we would very much so appreciate it if you add a link to my original repository in the README file

A Note Regarding Functionality:
1) Create a <canvas> element in the HTML document with an id of artCanvas for the library to work
2) There are basic instructions on implementation of the library at the end of the code as well as a short note at the beginning about the library itself
3) This library is meant to be a basic coding library to be used by amateur programmers and designers who want a free and simple way to create graphics using basic shapes
4) This library CAN be used to help make games (only as far as creating simple graphics) but it is extremely limited in that area as it was created for graphic design and not game dev
